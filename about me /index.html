    <p>Hola! My name is Derizabeth aka Deriz, my family is originally from Colombia, we moved to Canada about 20 
    years ago, I am currently enrolled in the technology bachelors program. I am married, my husband is from

    I currently manage a dental office and have been in the dental industry for 10 years. I like the opportunity we have to study
    through BYU Idaho and work at the same time. I am excited to take this web design course, I already told my family
    that if I am comfortable enough and learn a lot, I will find a job in web design.

    My parents are converts they met the missionaries more than 40 years ago, and were pioneers in their city, my dad passed 
    away abour two weeks ago, I am grateful that he and my mom accepted the gospel and that if I am faithful with to the covenants 
    I have made I will be able see him and my older sister who also passed years ago again. My favorite quote is by 
    Elder Jeffrey R. Holland "Above all, never lose faith in your Father in Heaven, who loves you more than you can comprehend." 
    I am looking forward to meeting you all, and I wish yousuccess as you continue on this path.
